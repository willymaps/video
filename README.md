# WIP Interactive video playback

Experiment using Mapbox for interactive video playback.

"Record playback path" passively collects lat/lng coordinates at the center of the map every interval. The video is slowed down to allow a user to capture rapidly changing scenes.

Built using:
- Svelte
- Mapbox
- Turf.js
